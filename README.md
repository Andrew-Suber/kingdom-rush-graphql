# Kingdom Rush GraphQL

Simply get Kingdom Rush Tower information through queries in GraphQL

## Tools

1. TypeOrm
2. Apollo Server
3. TypeGraphQL
4. Express
5. Postgresql
6. Jest
7. Typescript
8. GraphQL

## Notes

### Important!

-   currently when you remove a tower, it doesn't automatically delete the stats
-   even though you put onDelete : true
-   try: Put your @JoinColumn() on the inverse side (on MainStats)

-   https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/1460

Inspect database

```sql
psql -d kingdom_rush_db -U kingdom_rush_user
\dt
SELECT * FROM "Towers"
```

Run migrations and start the server

```bash

# Generate a migration file
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:generate -n 'MainStatsCreateTable'
```

`No migrations are pending` means that somewhere in the migration table it says that you have already run the migration for your migration file. Delete everything in the migration table. Run the migration again
